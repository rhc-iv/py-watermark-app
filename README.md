# Python Desktop Watermark App

From **Day 84** of **100 Days Of Python** taught by _Angela Yu_. This is a desktop app, written in **Python** that uses the `tkinter` and `pillow` libaries & allows the user to browse their computer, select an image (in the case of this particular app, .png files), then add a watermark to the selected image and save it.

Note that the directories used in the code are endimic to my computer file structure. The logo for the GUI and the watermark are also my own creations.
